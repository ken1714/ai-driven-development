# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Communication Language

All conversations and interactions should be conducted in Japanese (日本語).

## Repository Overview

This is a newly initialized repository for AI-driven development. The repository currently contains only a basic README.md file and appears to be in its initial setup phase.

## Project Structure

The repository is minimal at this stage:
- `README.md` - Basic project documentation
- No source code files present yet
- No build configuration or dependency management files

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository without established tooling:
- No package manager configuration found (no package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- No build system or development scripts available
- No testing framework configured
- No linting or formatting tools set up

## Architecture

The codebase architecture is not yet established. This repository appears to be ready for initial development setup and framework selection.

## Getting Started

This repository is in its initial state. Future development will need to:
1. Choose a programming language and framework
2. Set up package management and build tools
3. Establish project structure and architecture
4. Configure development tooling (linting, testing, etc.)

Future updates to this CLAUDE.md file should include specific build commands, testing procedures, and architectural decisions once they are established.
